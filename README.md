# Dynamic ERC20 Dex using LP pools

** Still working on this**

These minimal contracts allow for liquidity pools to be made between any two erc20 tokens without creating a new contract for each pair. DexV3 is not currently done but aims to improve upon DexV2 by enforcing adding/removing equal liquidity for each token in a pool. Dexv3 also aims to take swap fees and redistribute them to the liquidity providers. Both contracts use the constant product AMM (automated market maker) to price assets.

## Technologies

- Openzeppelin
- Ethers.js

## User Interface

I will be making a demo website that interacts with this contract
